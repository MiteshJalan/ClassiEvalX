# Student Grade Prediction System

The Student Grade Prediction System is a machine learning-based project that predicts the grades of students based on various factors. This system aims to assist educators in understanding and supporting student performance.

## Key Features

- Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Grade Prediction
- Performance Analysis
- Interpretability
- Deployment and Integration

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-grade-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd student-grade-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset: 
   - Ensure you have the student data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or Excel).
   - Place the dataset file in the `data/` directory.

2. Data preprocessing:
   - If required, modify the data preprocessing steps in the `data_preprocessing.py` file to suit your dataset.
   - Run the data preprocessing script:

     ```bash
     python data_preprocessing.py
     ```

3. Model training and evaluation:
   - Customize the model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics in the `model_training.py` file.
   - Train and evaluate the models:

     ```bash
     python model_training.py
     ```

4. Grade prediction:
   - Deploy the best-performing model using the `deploy_model.py` script.
   - Provide input features or student information to generate grade predictions.

5. Performance analysis and interpretability:
   - Explore the model's performance using the evaluation metrics and interpretability techniques provided in the `performance_analysis.ipynb` notebook.

6. Deployment and Integration:
   - Follow the deployment instructions in the `deployment.md` file for deploying the Student Grade Prediction System as a web application or API.
